🔍 What is if-else in Python?
The if, elif, and else keywords are used to control the flow of your program by allowing it to make decisions based on conditions.

Python checks a condition — if it's true, a block of code runs. If it's false, it checks the next condition (if using elif) or runs a final block (if using else).

🧠 How It Works
if:

Starts the decision-making.

Evaluates a condition (like comparing numbers or checking a variable).

If the condition is true, the indented block under the if runs.

If false, Python moves on.

elif (short for “else if”):

Optional.

Adds more conditions to check if the initial if was false.

Python checks them in order, top to bottom.

else:

Optional.

Runs if none of the previous if or elif conditions were true.

Acts as a "fallback" or default action.

📌 Important Characteristics
Only the first true condition runs. After that, Python skips the rest.

You can have multiple elif branches, but only one if and one else.

The body of each condition must be indented.

Conditions are usually created using comparison and logical operators.

🔗 When to Use
Making choices in your program.

Responding to user input.

Creating branching logic (e.g., menus, game rules, scoring systems).

Handling error checking or alternate outcomes.

🧠 Real-Life Analogy
Think of if-elif-else like traffic lights:

If the light is green → Go

Else if it’s yellow → Slow down

Else (must be red) → Stop

Only one action happens, based on the current condition.
