🔁 What Is the Modulo Operator?
The modulo operator, symbolized by a percent sign %, is a mathematical operator that gives you the remainder after one number is divided by another.

🔹 Think of it as:
"What’s left over after division?"

For example, if you divide 10 by 3:

3 goes into 10 three times (3 × 3 = 9)

The leftover (remainder) is 1

So: 10 modulo 3 is 1

🧠 What Does It Do?
It checks the remainder of a division.

If the number divides evenly (no remainder), the result is 0.

If there's a leftover part, it gives you that number.

📌 Why Is It Useful?
1. Checking Even or Odd Numbers
Any number divided by 2 will have:

A remainder of 0 → it's even

A remainder of 1 → it's odd

2. Looping and Repetition
Modulo helps cycle through patterns or restart counters.

Example: Looping through days of the week or rotating between 0 to 4 repeatedly.

3. Divisibility Checks
If a % b equals 0, then a is divisible by b.

4. Special Number Problems
Used in algorithms, calendars, time calculations, and puzzles.

⚠️ Important Notes
The result of modulo is always non-negative if the divisor is positive (in Python).

Modulo is not the same as division. It only gives the leftover part — not the whole result.

🧪 Real-World Example
Imagine you have 17 cookies and you want to give 5 to each friend:

Each friend gets 5 cookies

After giving cookies to 3 friends (15 total), you have 2 cookies left

That leftover 2 is the modulo result (17 modulo 5)
