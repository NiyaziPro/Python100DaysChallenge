🔍 What Are Logical Operators?
Logical operators are tools that allow Python to combine or modify conditions.
They're used in decision-making, especially with if, elif, and while statements.

These operators help answer questions like:

Are both conditions true?

Is at least one condition true?

Is a certain condition not true?

🧠 The Three Logical Operators
1. and
Means both conditions must be true for the result to be true.

If either condition is false, the result is false.

Think of it as: "This and that must happen."

2. or
Means at least one condition must be true.

If either condition is true, the result is true.

Think of it as: "This or that is enough."

3. not
Reverses a condition.

If something is true, not makes it false — and vice versa.

Think of it as: "This is not the case."

🔗 Real-Life Analogies
and: You can go to a party only if you are invited and you have a ticket.

or: You can enter a club if you're a member or a guest — either one is okay.

not: You cannot drive if you’re not licensed.

📌 Why Logical Operators Matter
They help Python make complex decisions.

They allow conditions to be more flexible and realistic.

You can combine multiple checks in a single statement.

Used in input validation, game logic, security checks, and more.

🧪 Summary
| Operator | Meaning                        | Result is True When…          |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `and`    | Both conditions are true       | **Both** sides are true       |
| `or`     | At least one condition is true | **Any one** side is true      |
| `not`    | Reverses the condition’s truth | The condition is **not true** |
