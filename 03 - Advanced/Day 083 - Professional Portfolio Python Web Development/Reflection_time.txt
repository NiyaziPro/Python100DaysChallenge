Reflection Journal – Portfolio Website Project
How I approached the project

I started by planning the structure of my portfolio website. I sketched a rough wireframe with sections I wanted to include:

A hero section with my name, a short tagline, and a call-to-action button.

An about section to introduce myself and explain my skills.

A projects section to showcase my work with screenshots, descriptions, and links.

A contact section with a form and social links.

After sketching, I thought about the design details: a clean, modern look with a minimal color scheme (dark background, accent color for highlights, and lots of whitespace). For typography, I picked one bold heading font and a clean, readable body font.

Then I broke the project into smaller steps:

Build the structure with HTML.

Add styles with CSS (flexbox/grid for layout).

Add interactivity with a little JavaScript (smooth scrolling, animations).

Optimize for responsiveness.

What was hard

Choosing a design: I wanted it to look unique but also professional. It was tough balancing creativity with usability.

Responsiveness: Getting the layout to work well across different screen sizes took a lot of testing.

Showcasing projects: I don’t have a huge portfolio yet, so deciding what to include and how to present it was tricky.

What was easy

Basic structure: Once I knew the sections I wanted, writing the initial HTML was straightforward.

Styling with CSS variables: Setting up a color palette and reusing it made the styling consistent and easier.

Adding animations: Using CSS transitions and small JavaScript effects made the site feel more dynamic.

How I might improve next time

Spend more time on the design phase before coding so I have a clearer vision.

Add more interactivity, such as filtering projects or using modals for detailed views.

Work on performance optimization (lazy loading images, minifying code).

Write cleaner, reusable CSS, possibly using a framework like Tailwind or SCSS.

Biggest learning from today

My biggest takeaway was that design is just as important as code. It’s not enough to make something functional — it also needs to look polished and reflect my personality as a developer. I also learned the value of planning: sketching and deciding colors/fonts ahead of time saved me frustration later.

What I’d do differently if I tackled this project again

Start with a mood board or inspiration board before coding.

Use a mobile-first approach to design instead of adjusting for mobile later.

Add testimonials or a blog section to make the portfolio feel more alive and engaging.

Possibly use a static site generator (like Next.js or Astro) for scalability.
